# Hi, I'm [Diego Kraenau](https://www.linkedin.com/in/diegokraenau/)! ðŸ‘‹

IÂ´m Diego Kraenau, a software engenieer student. In this repository you will find the documentation about the Project 1 of Java Bootcamp Everis.

## Documentation

Firts of all, you will need to donwload the [Endpoints](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1t3hBUhsIwdV7JnQm_P4gteE_MG-Y36Od/view?usp=sharing) and then you will need to import it on the postman.

In the next step, you will need to start the config server and then start the customer,account and transactions microservices.Before it, you will need to 
create the databases on mongodb. You can find the names in ConfigRepo, you will see the repositories below :


- [ConfigRepo](https://github.com/DiegoKraenauEveris/ConfigRepo)
- [ConfigServer](https://github.com/DiegoKraenauEveris/ConfigServer_P1)
- [CustomerMicroservice](https://github.com/DiegoKraenauEveris/Customer_Microservice_P1)
- [AccountMicroservice](https://github.com/DiegoKraenauEveris/Account_Microservice_P1)
- [TransactionMicroservice](https://github.com/DiegoKraenauEveris/Transaction_Microservice_P1)

After you start the microservices, you can use the endpoints that you imported on the postman, to recreate the process of the project you can see main endpoints 

![Endpoints](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/635630482901434379/901935170947514378/unknown.png)

So, you need to run these endpoints sequentially to recreate the process.

Finally, you could see the diagrams of the microservices in this [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TggPVqkG3WhqbxdBfyeCV-8V5EWQ7TTK/view?usp=sharing).
